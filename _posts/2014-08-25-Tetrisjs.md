[Tetris.js](http://www.umutozel.com/Tetris.js/ "Tetris.js"): A simple tetris with javascript and HTML5 Canvas.

I was playing with HTML5 canvas, suddenly I wanted to code a tetris and it easily turned into a challange: how short can I do this?

This is the result, 48 lines of javascript.

I know code is not clear, not fast, not bullet-proof (I intentionally removed some performance improvements and error check codes).
